			<h3 class='bullet-box__header'>Issues identified with existing COVID-19 app</h3>
			<p class='bullet-box__desc'>By running a preliminary survey and conducting user testing on the existing app, the following problems were identified:</p>
			<ul class='list'>
				<li class='list__item'>Usability was poor for those with advanced age or limited smartphone skill.</li>
				<li class='list__item'>Many users had trouble logging a test result into the app.</li>
				<li class='list__item'>Most users thought that the exposure notification gave too little information.</li>
				<li class='list__item'>The app didn’t have enough support functionality, and external redirects disrupted the user journeys.</li>
				<li class='list__item'>Existing app compromised functionality through use of fully-decentralised model</li>
				<li class='list__item'>No way for users to see history of infected contacts</li>
			</ul>
